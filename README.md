# ChampionMasteryLookup

You can find a live version at <http://championmasterylookup.derpthemeus.com/>

## Setup

Prerequisites: Node.js, NPM, Git

* Clone the project:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Derpthemeus/ChampionMasteryLookup.git
  cd ChampionMasteryLookup
  ```
* Install Node dependencies with `npm install`.
* Setup environmental variables and/or change `Config.ts`. The default `Config.ts` expects the environmental variable `RIOT_API_KEY` to be set to a [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) key. This is the only thing that needs to be set to run the server, but you may also want to change other options.
* Compile the TypeScript with `npm run compile`. Make sure you run this before starting the server each time you make changes.
* Start the server with `npm start`.

## Notes

* The technologies that this project uses may change even if the current technologies work fine. I sometimes use this project as a way for me to learn/practice new technologies.
* If you have an idea for a pull request, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Derpthemeus/ChampionMasteryLookup/issues/new) so we can discuss it first. I don't want you to waste your time creating a feature that I don't want to add for some reason.
